Description:   
    This is an advanced version of TDbasedUFE, which is a  comprehensive package
    to perform Tensor decomposition based unsupervised feature extraction.
    In contrast to TDbasedUFE which can perform simple the feature selection and 
    the multiomics analyses, this package can perform more complicated and 
    advanced features, but they are not so popularly required. Only users who 
    require more specific features can make use of its functionality.
