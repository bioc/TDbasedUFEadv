abstract = {{Identifying drug target genes in gene expression profiles is not straightforward. Because a drug targets proteins and not mRNAs, the mRNA expression of drug target genes is not always altered. In addition, the interaction between a drug and protein can be context dependent; this means that simple drug incubation experiments on cell lines do not always reflect the real situation during active disease. In this paper, I applied tensor-decomposition-based unsupervised feature extraction to the integrated analysis using a mathematical product of gene expression in various diseases and gene expression in the DrugMatrix dataset, where comprehensive data on gene expression during various drug treatments of rats are reported. I found that this strategy, in a fully unsupervised manner, enables researchers to identify a combined set of genes and compounds that significantly overlap with gene and drug interactions identified in the past. As an example illustrating the usefulness of this strategy in drug discovery experiments, I considered cirrhosis, for which no effective drugs have ever been proposed. The present strategy identified two promising therapeutic-target genes, CYPOR and HNFA4; for their protein products, bezafibrate was identified as a promising candidate drug, supported by in silico docking analysis.}},
