    abstract = "{Motivation: Molecule-based prediction of drug response is one major task of precision oncology. Recently, large-scale cancer genomic studies, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), provide the opportunity to evaluate the predictive utility of molecular data for clinical drug responses in multiple cancer types.Results: Here, we first curated the drug treatment information from TCGA. Four chemotherapeutic drugs had more than 180 clinical response records. Then, we developed a computational framework to evaluate the molecule based predictions of clinical responses of the four drugs and to identify the corresponding molecular signatures. Results show that mRNA or miRNA expressions can predict drug responses significantly better than random classifiers in specific cancer types. A few signature genes are involved in drug response related pathways, such as DDB1 in DNA repair pathway and DLL4 in Notch signaling pathway. Finally, we applied the framework to predict responses across multiple cancer types and found that the prediction performances get improved for cisplatin based on miRNA expressions. Integrative analysis of clinical drug response data and molecular data offers opportunities for discovering predictive markers in cancer. This study provides a starting point to objectively evaluate the molecule-based predictions of clinical drug responses.Contact:jgu@tsinghua.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

abstract = {{Identifying drug target genes in gene expression profiles is not straightforward. Because a drug targets proteins and not mRNAs, the mRNA expression of drug target genes is not always altered. In addition, the interaction between a drug and protein can be context dependent; this means that simple drug incubation experiments on cell lines do not always reflect the real situation during active disease. In this paper, I applied tensor-decomposition-based unsupervised feature extraction to the integrated analysis using a mathematical product of gene expression in various diseases and gene expression in the DrugMatrix dataset, where comprehensive data on gene expression during various drug treatments of rats are reported. I found that this strategy, in a fully unsupervised manner, enables researchers to identify a combined set of genes and compounds that significantly overlap with gene and drug interactions identified in the past. As an example illustrating the usefulness of this strategy in drug discovery experiments, I considered cirrhosis, for which no effective drugs have ever been proposed. The present strategy identified two promising therapeutic-target genes, CYPOR and HNFA4; for their protein products, bezafibrate was identified as a promising candidate drug, supported by in silico docking analysis.}},
